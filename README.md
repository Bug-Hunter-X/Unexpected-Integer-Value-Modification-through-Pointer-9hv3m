# Unexpected Integer Value Modification through Pointer
This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in C programming involving pointer manipulation and integer value modification. The core issue lies in how pointers directly affect the memory location they point to, potentially leading to unintended changes in variable values. The solution provides a clear explanation and improved code demonstrating safe pointer usage.
